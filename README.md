# Baseball-Simulation

This was a project I made in the summer of 2020 (during COVID) after having switched majors to Computer Science and taken one intro computer science class my Freshman year. The coding is not very impressive, and if I were to redo this I would have done things very differently, but I include this on my Github Page to show my interest in coding and software development stems beyond my college classes.
